    "\n",
    "The idea of using a color mask is to be able to filter out the unwanted objects that can alter the extraction of the desired features. In this case, the objective is to extract just the lane lines, which by convention, are either yellow or white. However, there exist different intensities of the same color that depend on the light conditions, thus afecting the robustness of the color mask algorithm. Therefore, an image mask algorithm is more robust when the *luma* ,or light intensity, is separated from the the color information on the image space. A color space alternative that takes the luma as a separate parameter is the hue, saturation, lightness (HLS) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HLS space is represented with a cylindrical geometry in mind, where hue is a parameter in the angular dimension, saturation is in the radial direction, and lightness is in the lenght dimention. This configurations allows the definition of an HLS color range that takes into consideration different light conditions. Therefore, the color mask that has been defined into the pipeline is based on an HLS color space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step towards the computation of the color mask is to transform the RGB image into the HLS color space. For this purpose we use the `cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2HLS)` function. The transformation of the RGB test images into the HLS space is shown below.\n",

However, before the gradients can be computed, a pre-processing of the image needs to be done. This means that the image color can be smoothed, thus eliminating some of the noise that the image contains. For this purpose, due to simplicity, it is assumed that the image contains gaussian white noise. This process is known as _gaussian bluring_ and is used tipically to reduce detail in images. The distortion of the image depends on kernel size that is used. \n",

    "After removing the most of the outliers, we can perform an averaging or extrapolation algorithm to obtain the main lines. In this case we have chosen to perform a least squares regression on the endpoints of the lines for each line set. The reason for chosing a regression algorithm over a  weighted mean or a simple line extrapolation is that we can include  cost function that could increase the accuracy of the results. An increased accuracy can be done by reducing the effects of the outliers on the overall solution.  The cost function chosen is the Huber loss, and is defined as:\n",

    "So far, we have defined a pipeline to identify the lane lines on a single image. However, before we can implement this algorithm on a subsequent set of images from a video feed, we need to handle the stability of the line detection. If we apply the pipeline as is, the pipeline can generate two main lines that appear to be moving on each frame. For this purpose, we have need to definea buffer so we can store the line coeffients that we have computed from the regression. Once we have stored the main line coefficients of at least 10 frames, we can average the coefficients stored in the buffer to smooth the vizualization. In order to define the buffer, we need to modify some of the functions previously defined so we can include a global variable. The final functions and pipeline is defined as follows:\n",

The reason for the increased computationtime is the increment of the time complexity when we started using the Hueber Loss regression. A potential fix on this issue is the use of an M estimator such as Msac or Ransac to detect the lines instead of using the Hough transform. The reason is that we can define the cost function as part of the regression.\n",
